## So, where to start?

Currently, we are a group of IT students who believe in technology. However, we also believe technology is not all about programming. Imagine all of the tech companies that are on their prime, or the companies from different industries trying to convert themselves to "tech" companies. They are all trying to achieve the same thing:

> The connection between their systems and their customers.

Therefore, we are not just a computer science club. We believe technology is a collective concept that includes but not limited to:

- Human and Computer Interactions
- Ethics of IT
- Design
- Product Engineering

## Why would you want to meet us?

If you're interested in the above mentioned topics, then you're more than welcomed here. We would like to know more people like you. 

> Because, products are built around people. 

If you like to help people by doing the thing you're doing best and trying to understand their problems, reach out to us. 

## Our members

We are an international club, meaning our members are from around the world. The difference between the cultures of our members is one of our club's strength. Perspective matters. 

Down below you can see our key contacts in case of questions:

- Club Lead: [Atakan](https://linkedin.com/in/atakanzen)
- Deputy Lead: [Vladimir](https://github.com/limtis0)
- People Lead: Kate

## What are our plans?

We are a club in the making[^1]. However, we have already some plans that we are trying to reform. For example: 

- Sessions and workshops about various topics such as design systems and programming languages. 
- Face-to-face or online meetings with talented people from the tech industry. 
- Book discussion sessions.

We believe all these things will help us to get better at helping people with technology. But, we still need your help!
